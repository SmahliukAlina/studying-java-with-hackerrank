 * This program is created for showing The Collatz conjecture, also known as Syracuse Problem.
 *
 * "The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows:
 * start with any positive integer n.
 * Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even,
 * the next term is one half of the previous term.
 * If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
 * The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1." (Wikipedia)
